# Coffee-shop-priskalkulator
This is a coffee shop price calculator made in python.

It will ask for the amount of cups it will then ask to input which type of coffee they want and then the size this is repeated based on how many,
cups they ordered and at the end it will ask if they want the coffee to go and add the extra charge based on the number of cups.
